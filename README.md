The aim of the work is to find out which functions can be used to obtain the highest
neural network accuracy. To achieve this goal, results are compared using optimization and activation
functions. For training and testing, MNIST handwritten digit database was selected, which consists of 70000
entries. The database consists of two different sources: handwritten digits of high school students and office
workers. After evaluating neural network model, the most accurate model was determined.
Here is the main model that was modified during the research, different activation and optimization functions were assigned to the model.
